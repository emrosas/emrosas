      <p class="opacity-50 font-light text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-prose mr-8">I have a background in Graphic Design and Marketing where, after a couple of years I discovered my love for creating unique interfaces that are compelling and solve problems for real people. I like to combine design, animation and development to unleash the full potential of the web.

          I consider myself a dedicated and proactive learner who is always looking for new ways to improve my skills, expand my knowledge and ultimately create better experiences for users and for myself. I'm currently working on improving my JavaScript skills and learning React as well as diving into Back End Development.
